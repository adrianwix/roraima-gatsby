It\r\n                  sounded exotic, it's something known in other countries but also symbolizes nature, so in November\r\n                  24th of 2013, Roraima Airlines was born. The colors were another things to deal, Roraima wasn't Red\r\n                  and black all the time, at beginning it was blue and green but by the pass of time, in 2016, Roraima\r\n                  changed to Red and Gray schemes.\r\n                  <br /><br />\r\n                    At the beginning of 2017, I received a proposal from the CEO of a virtual airline called Arabian\r\n                    Airlines, to let Roraima become a member of the GlobalOne Alliance, I thought, this could be really\r\n                    interesting, so I accepted, and then the discussions within the Alliance started to let Roraima be a\r\n                    member; some weeks later I received an excellent later, which said that Roraima was accepted to be a\r\n                    new proud member of GlobalOne Alliance. Everything since that day has been an great adventure,\r\n                    experience and opportunity to learn and grow for Roraima; my goal is to one day place Roraima as the\r\n                    number one airline by excellence in Venezuela, thanks to all the help GlobalOne, Arabian has\r\n                    provided to us and all the people who has contributed through the time to help Roraima become the\r\n                    best of all.\r\n                    <br /><br />\r\n\r\n                      History review by:<br />\r\n                      Emiliano Rujano<br />\r\n                      Funder / President / CEO\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"col-md-6\">\r\n              <img className=\"img-fluid w-100\" src={withPrefix(\"img/History.jpg\")} alt=\"\"/>\r\n                <p className=\"text-right mt-4\"><strong>Special Thanks to:</strong></p>\r\n                <p className=\"text-right\">â€‹Valeria Fernandez, Andres Yepes, Paola Mottola, Octavio Gomez, Samuel Garcia,\r\n                  Valeska Realza, Francisco Cernadas, Juan Pablo Villar, Jose Angel Dos Reis, Christiam Campoverde,\r\n                  Jesus Fuentes, Eric Basalo, Ricardo Pekelharing, Corina Meyer, Moises Moreno, Matias Campos, Alberto\r\n                  Gonzalez,\r\n                  Gilberto Guerra, Carlos Garcia, Adrian Wix, Mahmoud Fadli, Remington Box, Lukasz Musial, Sher Ming,\r\n                  Andrew Johnson and Chris Attheramp.</p>\r\n                <p className=\"text-right\"><strong>For all the support they provided to help Roraima become the\r\n                  best.</strong></p>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <Link className=\"btn btn-outline-black\" to=\"/\">BACK TO HOME</Link>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n        {/*Cierre de container*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n      {/*Cierre de container-fluid*/}\r\n\r\n    </section>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default History\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
