                Failure to exercise any right or remedy provided in these Terms
                shall not be construed as a waiver of any future exercise of
                that right or exercise of any other right or remedy untitled
                under these Terms. No term or provision of these Terms shall be
                deemed waived and no breach excused, unless such waiver or
                consent shall be in writing and signed by the parties. <br />
                <br />
                If any provision or provisions of these Terms is held by a court
                of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable
                for any reason, the remaining provisions not so declared shall
                nevertheless be construed in a manner as to effectuate the
                intent of these Terms as a whole, notwithstanding such stricken
                provision or provisions. <br />
                <br />
                The Terms, and any rights or obligations hereunder, are not
                assignable, transferable or sub-licensable by you except with
                flyroraima.com prior written consent, but may be assigned or
                transferred by us without restriction. Any attempted assignment
                by you shall violate these Terms and be void. <br />
                <br />
                The section headings contained in these Terms are for convenient
                reference only, and shall not in any way affect the meaning or

                not all) Cookies through your device or browser settings, but
                doing so may affect the functionality of the Site.

                <br />
                a. Advertisers: We may allow third parties to use Cookies
                through the Site to collect the same type of information for the
                same purposes as flyroraima.com does for itself. Third parties
                may be able to associate the information they collect with other
                information they have about you from other sources. Please note
                that opting out does not prevent the display of all
                advertisements to you. Additionally, we may share non-personally
                identifiable information from or about you with third parties,
                such as location data, advertising identifiers, or a
                cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an
                email address), to facilitate the display of targeted
                advertising.
                <br />
                <br />
                b. Service Providers: We may rely on third party providers to
                support or provide some of the services that are available
                through the Site. We may also rely on third party providers to
                perform certain services for us in connection with your use of
                the Site, such as communications and hosting services, network
                security, technical and customer support, tracking and reporting
                functions, our own marketing of the Site, and other functions.
                We may share information from or about you with these third
                party providers so that they can perform their services. These
                third party providers may share information with us that they
                obtain from or about you in connection with providing their
                services.
                <br />
                <br />
                c. Aggregate Information: We may share user information in the
                aggregate with third parties, such as advertisers and content
                distributors.
                <br />
                <br />
                d. Investigations: We may investigate and disclose information
                from or about you if we have a good faith belief that such
                investigation or disclosure (a) is reasonably necessary to
                comply with legal process and law enforcement instructions and
                orders, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, judicial
                proceeding, or other legal process served on us; (b) is helpful
                to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in
                connection with the Service; or (c) protects our rights,
                reputation, property, or that of our users, affiliates, or the
                public. If you flag or otherwise complain to flyroraima.com
                about content through the Site, we may share the substance of
                your complaint with the contributor of that content in order to
                provide an opportunity for the contributor to respond.
                <br />
                <br />
                e. Links: The Service may contain links to unaffiliated third
                party services. Except as set forth herein, we do not share your
                personal information with them, and are not responsible for
                their privacy practices. We suggest you read the privacy
                policies on or applicable to all such third party services.
                <br />
                <br />
                5) Data Retention and Account Termination: You can close your
                account at any time. We may retain information about you for the
                purposes authorized under this Privacy Policy unless prohibited
                by law. For example, we may retain information to prevent,
                investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with
                the Site or to comply with legal obligations.
                <br />
                <br />
                6) Children: We do not knowingly collect personal information
                from children under 13. If you become aware that a child has
                provided us with personal information without parental consent,
                please contact us through this Site. If we become aware that a
                child under 13 has provided us with personal information without
                parental consent, we take steps to remove such information and
                terminate the child\'s account. We are committed to protecting
                the privacy of young children, and therefore do not knowingly
                collect or maintain personally identifiable information on the
                Site or Service from persons under 13 years of age, except in
                compliance with the Children\'s Online Privacy Protection Act of
                1998 ("COPPA"). Accordingly, children under the age of 13 may
                only use the Site or the Service with the supervision of their
                parent/guardian. Additionally, teachers and schools seeking to
                use the Site or Service in the classroom with children under 13
                years of age, are required to obtain the express consent of such
                children\'s parent/guardian in compliance with COPPA, prior to
                permitting such children to access or use the Site or Service.
                <br />
                <br />
                7) Security. We have taken steps to protect the personal
                information submitted to us. However, no method of transmission
                over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic
                storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect
                your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute
                security.
                <br />
                <br />
                8) Dispute Resolution. If you believe that flyroraima.com has
                not adhered to this Privacy Policy, you may contact us online by
                going to our Contact Us page.
                <br />
                <br />
                10) Modifications to this Privacy Policy: We may revise this
                Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of
                the Privacy Policy will govern our collection, use, and
                disclosure of information about you and will be located on this
                page. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we
                will notify you by email or by posting a notice on the Site
                prior to the effective date of the changes. By continuing to
                access or use the Site after those changes become effective, you
                agree to the revised Privacy Policy.
