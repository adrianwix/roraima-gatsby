It sounded exotic, it's something known in other countries\r\n                but also symbolizes nature, so in November 24th of 2013, Roraima\r\n                Airlines was born. The colors were another things to deal,\r\n                Roraima wasn't Red and black all the time, at beginning it was\r\n                blue and green but by the pass of time, in 2016, Roraima changed\r\n                to Red and Gray schemes.\r\n                <br />\r\n                <br />\r\n                At the beginning of 2017, I received a proposal from the CEO of\r\n                a virtual airline called Arabian Airlines, to let Roraima become\r\n                a member of the GlobalOne Alliance, I thought, this could be\r\n                really interesting, so I accepted, and then the discussions\r\n                within the Alliance started to let Roraima be a member; some\r\n                weeks later I received an excellent later, which said that\r\n                Roraima was accepted to be a new proud member of GlobalOne\r\n                Alliance. Everything since that day has been an great adventure,\r\n                experience and opportunity to learn and grow for Roraima; my\r\n                goal is to one day place Roraima as the number one airline by\r\n                excellence in Venezuela, thanks to all the help GlobalOne,\r\n                Arabian has provided to us and all the people who has\r\n                contributed through the time to help Roraima become the best of\r\n                all.\r\n                <br />\r\n                <br />\r\n                History review by:\r\n                <br />\r\n                Emiliano Rujano\r\n                <br />\r\n                Funder / President / CEO\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <div className=\"col-md-6\">\r\n              <img\r\n                className=\"img-fluid w-100\"\r\n                src={withPrefix('img/History.jpg')}\r\n                alt=\"\"\r\n              />\r\n              <p data-aos=\"fade-left\" className=\"text-right mt-4\">\r\n                <strong>Special Thanks to:</strong>\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p data-aos=\"fade-left\" className=\"text-right\">\r\n                â€‹Valeria Fernandez, Andres Yepes, Paola Mottola, Octavio Gomez,\r\n                Samuel Garcia, Valeska Realza, Francisco Cernadas, Juan Pablo\r\n                Villar, Jose Angel Dos Reis, Christiam Campoverde, Jesus\r\n                Fuentes, Eric Basalo, Ricardo Pekelharing, Corina Meyer, Moises\r\n                Moreno, Matias Campos, Alberto Gonzalez, Gilberto Guerra, Carlos\r\n                Garcia, Adrian Wix, Mahmoud Fadli, Remington Box, Lukasz Musial,\r\n                Sher Ming, Andrew Johnson and Chris Attheramp.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p data-aos=\"fade-left\" className=\"text-right\">\r\n                <strong>\r\n                  For all the support they provided to help Roraima become the\r\n                  best.\r\n                </strong>\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <Link className=\"btn btn-outline-black\" to=\"/\">\r\n            BACK TO HOME\r\n          </Link>\r\n        </div>\r\n        {/*Cierre de container*/}\r\n      </div>\r\n      {/*Cierre de container-fluid*/}\r\n    </section>\r\n  </Layout>\r\n)\r\n\r\nexport default History\r\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
